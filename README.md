Module 3: Python
Used Stack Overflow forum to create a dicitonary by looping through candidates, votes, and percents lists. See code below in lines 3-7
[
    {'name': name, 'job': job, 'status': status}
    for name, job, status in zip(names, jobs, statuses)
]
An adaptation of this was used in line [65] of main.ipynb
